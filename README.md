# Week 08 v1 Assessment

## Guidelines

Assessments are meant to give you and Hack Reactor staff an idea of how well you understand, or can figure out, the material that you covered recently.

- Turn off all communication devices such as your phone, email, Slack, etc.
- Fork this repo and clone down your fork to your laptop.
- Commit **working** code early and often (at least after every prompt). You are graded on your commit messages in addition to the code that you write

`[When this code is committed it will] Complete the basic-iteration prompt`

- Use the Chrome Console [Snippets](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/snippets) feature to author, test and debug your code before committing. An approved alternate tool is [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). You are **NOT PERMITTED** to use [repl.it](https://repl.it/) to work on or complete this assessment.
- Do at least a little work on *every* prompt, even if you only leave comments that describe your intent. **Leaving a prompt blank is tantamount to failing a prompt. You'll get much more credit even for writing comments or pseudo-code that describe your intent**
- You **must** submit a pull request for all assessments **on time** (guidelines for how to submit a pull request are below). Give yourself several minutes to do this at the end of the time allotted for the assessment
- The help button is available to you during assessments, how often you use it is up to your own discretion
- After completing the assessment, if there are any prompts you felt you did not do well on, or, that you would not know how to assess whether or not you did well on, make plans to improve your skills on that topic **as soon as possible.**

## Using and Referencing Outside Resources

Each prompt contains a list of outside resources you are allowed to use to support your work on that prompt. Using *any* other resources, online or otherwise, including previous class materials, or, communicating through any mechanism with anyone other than Hack Reactor staff during the assessments is academic dishonesty and is cause for **immediate removal from the course.** If you have any questions about whether a resource is available for use, or if you are in need of support, submit a help request.


## Submitting Solutions

Submissions are submitted in Learn. Make sure that all your changes are committed and pushed your fork of the assessment. Then copy and paste the Github URL into the available text box. Please hit `Run Tests` to make sure that **Learn** runs your code as you expect.

Once you are satisfied that **Submit** your work.
